    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991.\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. \n",
    "4. What is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    ".py\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    " a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "by using # at the beginning of each line of the comment\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "sys.version() or python -v \n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called lambda. Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can be used wherever normal functions can be used.\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "pip stands for \"preferred installer program\". The standard package manager for Python is pip . It allows you to install and manage packages that aren't part of the Python standard library.\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "Python Built-in Functions\n",
    "print( ) function,type( ) function,input( ) function,abs( ) function,pow( ) function,dir( ) function,sorted( ) function,max( ) function\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. That means whenever we want to give an entity a name, that's called identifier.\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "Top 10 Advantages Of Python\n",
    "It’s easy to read, learn, and write.\n",
    "This is one of the key advantages of Python. Python is a high level programming language that has a syntax similar to English. This makes it easier to understand and read the code. Python is easy to learn and is highly recommended by many. You will need fewer lines of code than other languages such as Java and C/C++ to achieve the same task.\n",
    "Increased Productivity\n",
    "Python is a very useful programming language. Because Python is so simple, developers can focus on the topic at hand. They don’t have to spend too much time learning about the syntax and behaviour of programming languages. You can write less code, but accomplish more.\n",
    "Interpreted Language\n",
    "Python is an interpretable language. This means that Python executes the code line-by-line. It reports any errors and stops execution. Python displays only one fault, even if there are many. This makes it easier to debug.\n",
    "Dynamically Typed\n",
    "Python doesn’t know what type of variable it is until we execute the code. It assigns the data type to you automatically when it executes. It is not necessary for the programmer to declare variables and their data types.\n",
    "Open Source and Free\n",
    "Python is distributed under an OSI-approved open-source license. It is free to download and use. The source code can be downloaded, modified, and shared with others. This is useful for companies who want to modify a behavior or create their own version.\n",
    "Vast Libraries Support\n",
    "The Python standard library is large and contains almost all the functions you need to do your work. You won’t have to depend on third party libraries.\n",
    "Even if you don’t, a Python Package Manager (pip), makes it much easier to import additional packages from the Python Package Index (PyPi). There are approximately 200,000 packages.\n",
    "Portability\n",
    "To run your program on different platforms, you will need to update your code in C/C++. This is not true for Python. It is possible to use it anywhere, once you have written it. However, you should avoid any system-dependent functionality.\n",
    "IOT Opportunities\n",
    "Python is at the heart of many new platforms such as the Raspberry Pi. It sees a bright future in the Internet of Things. This is a way to bridge the gap between language and real world.\n",
    "Object-Oriented\n",
    "This language supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. Functions are useful for reusability. Classes and objects enable us to simulate the real-world.\n",
    "Embeddable\n",
    "Python can also be embedded, which aids in its extensibility. Python code can be included in the source code for another language such as C++. This allows us add scripting capabilities to the code of another language.\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "• Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "• Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "• Clicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\n",
    "• In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "• Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n"
